The workout tracker is an application that allows a user to keep track of various exercises they perform with certain criteria options such as reps, duration, and exercise. This app also includes a dashboard with a weekly summary of all of the workouts, displayed on a graph.

## Installation:

* git clone repository
* npm install
* node server.js

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongoose

## Challenges

This assignment was easily the most difficult of the class thus far - I had some confusion with Mongoose and did not get the app working perfectly. I tried a Virtual to make the 'total duration' field work, but did not succeed. 

## Successes

Further understanding of Javascript and back end technology/functionality - how the front end and back end talk with each other to send data and perform an operation.
