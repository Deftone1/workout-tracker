# workout-tracker

The workout tracker is an application that allows a user to keep track of various exercises they perform with certain criteria options such as reps, duration, and exercise. This app also includes a dashboard with a weekly summary of all of the workouts, displayed on a graph.

## Installation:

* git clone repository
* npm install
* node server.js

# Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongoose

# Challenges

This assignment was easily the most difficult of the class thus far - I had trouble understanding the functionality of MongoDB/Mongoose and did not fully get the app working perfectly. I tried using the Mongoose Virtual to connect the data needed for the total duration of the workout, but did not figure it out. 

# Successes

Further understanding of Javascript and backend technologies, and how the front end and back end talk with each other to send data and perform an operation.
